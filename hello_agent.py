"""Lab 1 — Your very first agent (provided & complete).

This agent already works. Your Lab 1 job is to READ it, understand the four
pieces every agent has — a role + a goal + a backstory + a tool — then make it
your own by changing its personality. Reading and improving working code is a
core skill, especially now that AI writes so much of it.

Run it in the terminal:  python hello_agent.py
Test it in a web UI:     streamlit run test_apps/lab1_meet_your_agent.py
