"""Task definitions for the Startup Idea Validator crew.

🔨 YOU BUILD THIS FILE (with the instructor).

A Task = a `description` (what to do) + an `expected_output` (the shape of the
answer) + the `agent` that owns it.

  • build_bull_task → ✅ DONE for you (your worked example)
  • build_bear_task → 🔨 TODO (Lab 2): mirror the bull task, but argue the opposite
  • build_memo_task → ✅ PROVIDED (the memo's structure is long, so it's given)

Stuck? Ask in your breakout room — we'll work through it together at the regroup.
